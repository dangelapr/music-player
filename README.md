# music-player

This is a simple music player made using JS. It plays 3 songs in rotation with play/pause, forward and backward buttons. It has a playtime indicator, and a spinning "record" with an image to represent the song. 

This was a fun project because it allowed me to add audio files which I hadn't worked with until this point.

I would love to improve this by adding visuals to make it look like an iPod classic, or maybe imitating the layout of Spotify.
